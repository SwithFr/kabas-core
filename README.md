**A flexible CMS**

Ever wanted a light, simple yet flexible Content Management System? That's exactly what we're trying to build here. Based on the ideas behind Laravel and some of its components, Kabas is already deployed on a few websites and will be published as an Open-Source Project as soon as we'll reach a completely stable version. Stay tuned !

> **Note:** this repository only contains the core files for Kabas. To run a fully equiped instance of the CMS, please use the Kabas\Project repository instead.


## Testing

Please consider running all available unit tests when making changes to the core system.
